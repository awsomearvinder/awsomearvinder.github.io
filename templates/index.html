<h2 id="title">Hi, this is my personal page.</a></h2>
<p> Check out my projects <a href = "{{get_url(path="@/projects/index.md")}}">here</a>.
I like coding, my favorite language is rust, but I can get by in most languages.
Python is fun, and so is Typescript. C++ is a passing interest in mine, but
I can't claim to be super proficinet at it. I enjoy learning programming languages.
I've tried haskell and friends too. :)</p>
